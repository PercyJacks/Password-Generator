# Password-Generator
Application that generates a random password given a criteria input by the user.

This challenge demonstrates the use of javascript to interact with html and css to display a random password on the screen.

# Challenges

The main challenge was figuring out the best way to get user input and also how to make the code validate for each input.

# Things I learned

I learnt that you can use JavaScript to directly edit the html via the DOM.
